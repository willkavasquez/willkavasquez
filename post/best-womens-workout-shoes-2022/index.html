        <p>These women&#039;s workout clothes will help you sweat it out in yoga, running, barre, and more. Whether you spend your time lifting weights, pedaling in a cycling class, or grinding away on a treadmill, you need a good pair of sneakers if you&#039;re going to hit the gym. While sporting lacy delicates won&#039;t stop you from getting a great workout, they&#039;re definitely not designed for that kind of physical activity.</p>
