        <p>Starting as early as mid october, the trees at lower elevations will also begin to shift into their fall colors. At this time, you can expect to see fall colors blooming on the scarlet oak, the spicebush, the sweetgum, the sugar maple, the red maple, the sumac, the tulip and the hickory trees. The landscape here is populated with sugar maples, hickories, sweetgum, scarlet oaks, red maples and nearly 100 other species of native trees.</p>
